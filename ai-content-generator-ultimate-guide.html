<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Introduction</strong></h1>



<p>In the early days of artificial intelligence, there were high hopes for a future in which machines could generate text that was indistinguishable(alike) from human-generated text.This goal has remained elusive(difficult to achieve), as even the most advanced AI systems can still only generate text that is recognizable as machine-generated.</p>



<p>However, recent breakthroughs suggest that this goal may be more achievable than once thought. In this blog post, we discuss about new trend about AI Content Generator tools in which AI text generation is currently being used and explore the potential implications of these applications.</p>



<p>And in this blog, we will provide the comparision between human &amp; machines so that you can have in-depth understanding of pros &amp; cons between <a href="#human-vs-machine" data-type="internal" data-id="#human-vs-machine">Human vs Machine</a>.This article will clear all your questions regarding AI Content Generator so that you can take right decision in terms of when &amp; how you should use ai-tools.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>Many people have doubts because they don’t clarify the terminology.</em></strong></h2>



<p>Throwing a lot of terms without further explanation raises doubts and questions. For instance, what do you think when you first hear the term AI (Artificial Intelligence). Of course, you will picture the two words i.e Artificial(Human Made) &amp; Intelligence(Intellect) so it’s Artificial Machine that has intellect made by human beings. However, reading more about AI will give you a more detailed explanation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>Putting Question(?) mark at the end of statement doesn’t mean it’s a valid question?</em></strong></h2>



<p><a href="#will-ai-replace-human-writer" data-type="internal" data-id="#will-ai-replace-human-writer">Will AI Content Generators Replace Human Writers or not?</a> It’s like asking, Is today Friday or Saturday? You see, the wording of this question is a “yes” or “no” question. Saying “yes” or “no” is not enough and needs to be explained.</p>



<p>According to CIFS expert <a href="https://dk.linkedin.com/in/timothyshoup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Timothy Shoup</a>, by 2025-2030, more than 99% of internet content will be generated by artificial intelligence, especially as models like GPT3 <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI</a> become more widely adopted. “The Internet will be completely unrecognizable,” Shoup told her colleague <a href="https://dk.linkedin.com/in/sofiehvitved" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophie Hvitved</a>.</p>



<p>There is a lot of doubts and question regarding ai-generated-contents pros and cons in the IT industry.</p>



<p>We’ll provide you with a comprehensive understanding of ai-generator tools and success stories. To find out what are the questions, doubts people have and how ai-user getting successful results then continue reading…</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-contents"><strong>What are Contents?</strong></h2>



<p>A topic or subject covered by a book or document that can be expressed through a medium like in the form of image, text, video, audio &amp; so on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-generator"><strong>What is Generator?</strong></h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://dk.linkedin.com/in/timothyshoup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Timothy Shoup</a> who is Senior Advisor &amp; Futurist at <a href="https://cifs.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Copenhagen Institute</a> for Futures Studies said By 2025-2030, more than 99% of internet content will be generated by artificial intelligence. In General term, a Generator means a person or thing that produce or convert into something. In this context, we are talking about Content Generator.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-content-generator"><strong>What is a Content Generator?</strong></h2>



<p>A content generator is a machine or tool that can generate content such as text, images, video, and audio.</p>



<p>For example, a computer is a machine that can generate text, images, sounds etc. with human intervention, but if the tool or machine produces content with minimum or little effort like we have <a href="https://assistant.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">google AI Voice Assistant</a>, AI content generator tools will appear in this game. Well, what is AI(Artificial Intelligence)?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-ai"><strong>What is AI (Artificial Intelligence)?</strong></h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia</a>, AI or Artificial Intelligence is the science &amp; engineering discipline of training machines for performing human tasks. ML or Machine Learning is the subset of AI that teaches machines to learn.</p>



<p>AI is a branch of computer science that deals with the design and development of intelligent agents, or machines that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. AI technologies help to reduce human effort.</p>



<p>AI is a broad term and it can be used to refer to anything from machine learning algorithms to self-driving cars. But what really defines AI is that it’s a machine that can sense its environment, make decisions, and act on those decisions in an autonomous manner based on trained data.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>General Difference between Human vs Machines</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li>When a machine’s engine fails, it can be replaced, but once a person is dead, bodily components cannot be replaced and the person cannot be brought back to life.</li>



<li>Humans produce new data that AI machines use.</li>



<li>Humans are the creators of machines, so we are able to run them any way we want, i.e. Humans are the masters and machines are the servants.</li>



<li>Machines don’t possess imagination, however, people have imagination and concepts that allow us to conceive about anything because anything is possible in the human mind.</li>



<li>Machines only have tangible possessions, whereas humans have both material and immaterial possessions, such as consciousness (the state of being aware).</li>



<li>Machines are unable to become pregnant, whereas humans are able to enjoy their sexual lives.</li>



<li>Machine is used in dangerous areas like in war where human don’t want to be in danger.</li>



<li>Both humans &amp; machines have an expiry date.</li>
</ul>



<p>Let’s be real, one AI machine can’t be pregnant <img draggable="false" role="img" class="emoji" alt="😃" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/svg/1f603.svg"> and can’t produce another AI machine that can do self-learning &amp; go through several stages as a human does.</p>



<p>To create any AI machines, we need prior massive datasets to train AI machines and feed the code of instruction into them, but when a child is born, they suck their mother’s breast from day one, move their hands, cry, and so on, and as they grow, they learn and act on the basis of their previous experience. The question is, who, in the first place, programmed the code of instruction in human beings?</p>



<p>Do you think, these human actions just appear from nowhere? The answer is big <em>NO </em>according to me. I leave this question up to you.</p>



<p>When some people hear this kind of remark, they immediately think to themselves, “Perhaps it will happen in the future.” Is it possible that you’ll transform into a cockroach in the future as a result of my response to them?</p>



<p>The question is not if it is possible, but whether AI machines will ever be able to replace humans. The short answer is a big NO, and AI will never entirely replace humans, particularly when it comes to consciousness.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://freeitools.com/consc.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Philosopher David Chalmers</a> writes that “even once we have solved all such problems about the brain and experience, the hard problem of consciousness will still persist”.</p>



<p>I’m very sure anyone who’s reading you’ll not live here last forever. Technologies are evolving day by day which brings improvement in our IT industry that makes human tasks effective &amp; fast. So take participate &amp; think within the life span of modern age paradigm &amp; don’t make your perception extreme by saying a stupid statement like yeah! It is possible that we can turn into a cockroach in the future.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="can-dataset-be-transferable"><strong>Can the dataset be transferable?</strong></h2>



<p>yes, there is a topic called Transfer Learning in Deep learning concepts. here you can find more in detail: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-hands-on-guide-to-transfer-learning-with-real-world-applications-in-deep-learning-212bf3b2f27a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LINK</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-transfer-learning"><strong>What is Transfer Learning?</strong></h2>



<p>Transfer learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on one task and then applied to a different task.</p>



<p>The model can be trained on an easier or harder task, depending on its level of expertise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="example-of-transfer-learning"><strong>Example of Transfer Learning</strong></h2>



<p>Transfer Learning can be used in many ways. For example, it can be used in computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection and segmentation or it can be used for natural language processing tasks like sentiment analysis or text categorization.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pros-of-transfer-learning"><strong>Pros of Transfer Learning</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li>Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that has been developed to reduce the time and cost of training deep neural networks.</li>



<li>The basic idea behind transfer learning is to use the knowledge gained from a previous task or tasks to address new tasks.</li>



<li>The major benefit is that it helps to reduce the investment &amp; effort by making reusable</li>

</div>



<p>According to me, In the future, artificial intelligence will be used in many different industries such as healthcare, IT, banking, education and advertising. It will make automation tasks effective &amp; easier.</p>



<p>The future of AI is not set in stone. It will depend on the actions we take today. If we want a future of AI that benefits us all, it’s important to work together and create an open, inclusive society where everyone has a friendly discussion as well as opportunities.</p>



<p>AI is a highly debated topic these days and there are many different opinions about what the future holds for it. Some believe that AI will soon become self-aware, while others believe it will never happen at all.</p>



<p>Artificial Intelligence is the future. It is an inevitable force that will change the way we live and work.</p>



<p>AI will have a significant impact on our lives in the near future, but it’s not all good news. There are many things that we need to be aware of to ensure AI has a positive effect on society and doesn’t become dangerous.</p>



<p>The Future of Artificial Intelligence is something that many people are concerned about, but nobody really knows what’s going to happen with this technology in the coming years and decades.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="will-ai-take-our-jobs"><strong>Will AI take our Jobs?</strong></h2>



<p>The short answer is<strong> <em>NO</em></strong>, rather it creates more opportunities.</p>



<p>It is a common misconception that AI will take over our jobs. This is not true, and it would be impossible for AI to replace us. AI cannot replace the human touch, creativity, and emotions that we bring to our jobs.</p>



<p>The reality is that AI will only take over certain tasks in the workplace and it will never be able to replace humans.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="example-of-ai"><strong>Example of Artificial Intelligence</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most popular examples of Artificial Intelligence is a <a href="https://support.google.com/chat/answer/9649420?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chatbot</a>. A chatbot is an automated program that can respond to queries and provide information.</p>



<p>Chatbots are increasingly becoming popular with companies. They use them in a number of ways, such as customer service, lead generation, and marketing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading what-are-ai-contents" id="what-are-ai-contents"><strong>What are AI Contents?</strong></h2>



<p>AI Contents are a new form of content that is created by artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>AI Contents are generated by artificial intelligence software, which analyzes what people usually like and then creates a story based on those preferences. AI Contents can be used for any type of content, such as articles, blog posts, social media posts and more.</p>



<p>AI Contents are not just a replacement for human-written content but rather an extension of it. They provide a new way to create engaging stories and help us understand the world around us better than ever before.</p>



<p>The goal of AI content is to provide the same level of quality as human-generated content while reducing the time and effort it takes to create it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-ai-content-generator"><strong>What is AI Content Generator (AICG)?</strong></h2>



<p>AI content generator is an AI-powered tool that can generate content at scale. It generates articles, blog posts, and web pages for businesses and individuals. It is a great way for companies to reach their target audiences with fresh content that can be updated on a regular basis.</p>



<p>There are many potential applications for the AI content generator. It could be used to create content for websites, blogs, social media posts, or even marketing materials. The AI content generator could also be used to help businesses create unique and original content for their customers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-ai-tools-work"><strong>How do AI Content Generator tools work?</strong></h2>



<p>AI content generator tools are a great way to get started with generating content. They can be helpful for quickly generating blog posts, articles, and other types of content.</p>



<p>The AI content generator uses machine learning, natural language processing and other technologies to produce text. The technology learns from the writer’s style and creates a new piece of text in the same style as the original writer.</p>



<p>There are two ways in which AI content generator tools work. One is by providing a set of pre-written templates to the user and the other one is by generating content on a topic of interest.</p>



<p>The first one is more like an AI writer assistant, where it provides pre-written templates to its users. It does this by understanding what kind of content the user needs and then suggesting templates for that kind of content. This can be anything from blog posts, articles, or social media updates.</p>



<p>The second way in which these tools work is by generating content on a topic or niche that the user wants to write about. These tools are able to do this because they have a database of information on different topics and they can use that database to generate original written text on any given subject matter.</p>



<p>The AI content generator is a computer program that is designed to produce pieces of text, usually on a specific topic. The program analyzes a database of sources in order to understand the topic and then writes a piece of text based on what it has learned.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="benefits-of-ai-content-generator"><strong>Benefits of AI Content Generator</strong></h2>



<p>AI content generator is software that can automatically generate content for any given topic. It does this by analyzing the keywords and phrases that are relevant to the topic.</p>



<p>The benefits of AI content generator are:</p>



<ul>
<li>It generates quality content on a specific topic</li>



<li>It saves time for the writer by generating articles at scale</li>



<li>It helps writers focus on what they do best, creativity and emotions</li>



<li>AI content generators are versatile</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="will-ai-replace-human-writer"><strong>Will AI Content Generator replace Content Writer?</strong></h2>



<p>There is no doubt that artificial intelligence (AI) has made tremendous progress in the past few years and it is now being used in a number of industries, including content writing. With the help of AI, businesses can now create high-quality content at a fraction of the cost, saves a lot of time &amp; increase productivity.</p>



<p>There are a number of AI content generators available in the market, and more are being launched every day. These content generators are becoming more and more sophisticated with each passing day. They can now not only generate high-quality content but also modify it according to the specific requirements of the customer.</p>



<p>So, the question is: Will AI Content Generator replace Human Writer?</p>



<p>In this rapidly changing digital age, it’s hard to know what’s coming next. So, it’s no surprise that there is a lot of speculation about whether artificial intelligence will eventually replace content writers. While it’s still too early to say for sure, we will be sure to keep you updated on our site.</p>



<p>There is no doubt that AI content generators will play a big role in the content writing industry in the years to come. However, it is still too early to say whether or not they will completely replace content writers.</p>



<p>No, AI content generator is not a replacement for content writers. It can only generate content ideas at scale.</p>



<p>Content writers are responsible for the creative aspect of the content and the emotions that it conveys. They need to know what the audience wants and how they want to feel when they read it.</p>



<p>AI writing assistants are just tools that assist human copywriters in their work by getting rid of writer’s block and generating content ideas at scale.</p>



<p>Content is generated by AI technologies from a pre-existing collection of organized data, but content writers have the ability to use their imagination and the teaching process to create content that doesn’t exist in the first place.</p>



<p>Our imagination (the faculty or action of generating new ideas) is a magnificent tool that we have inherited as humans. AI tools, on the other hand, lack the ability to imagine. AI tools can only provide content based on the information we’ve given them through training models.</p>



<p>The capacity to improve existing content is one of the most significant advantages of AI content.</p>



<p>Humans are becoming more lazy &amp; unhealthy because of the latest technologies that don’t require too much physical effort. Nowadays, the task is done faster with the help of the latest technologies.</p>



<p>According to me, AI will never &amp; ever replace human beings because to train AI machines we need prior huge datasets &amp; that data comes from humans, not the AI machine itself generates.</p>



<p>Similarly, AI content generator tools can’t replace human writers <em>but rather they add an additional way of doing things for writers</em> that can help to do their tasks faster, accurate &amp; can generate more contents in less amount time.</p>



<p>Those writers that focus on factual information with non-insightful analysis will be replaced for sure. A lot of them have already been replaced in this scenario but as for writers who focus on creative writing, imagination or opinions will not be replaced ever.</p>



<p>AI can replace those writers whose writing falls under repeated or already existed but it can never replace creative people with spontaneous ideas.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/William-Vietinghoff?q=William%20Vie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">William Vietinghoff</a>, Rocket Test Site Visitor Consultant (2010 – present) said ” AI devices can’t experience human feelings &amp; emotions: cold, heat, itch, joy, pain, pleasure, sorrow, excitement, surprise, disappointment, fear, irritation. Therefore, an AI device can’t write those experiences into a story”. He also said, we enjoy literature because each author describes those sensations in a different way.</p>



<p>The Artificial Intelligence ( AI) of today is not smart as we are. It may be smarter &amp; faster in some areas &amp; a bigger jerk in others but it can’t match our intellectual &amp; emotional intelligence. That’s what makes humans &amp; that’s what makes the best content writers so good at their task.</p>



<p>The fact is most of us are AI consumers even programmers are AI consumers. The inventor of AI is very few &amp; it requires high knowledge of understanding Mathematics &amp; Computer Science.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tips-and-warning-of-ai-content-generator"><strong>Important Tips &amp; Warnings regarding AI Content Generator</strong></h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-plagiarism-content"><strong>What are plagiarism contents?</strong></h2>



<p>Plagiarism is the act of copying someone else’s work and presenting it as one’s own.</p>



<p>Plagiarism can be intentional or unintentional, and it is considered a form of academic dishonesty. One of the most common forms of plagiarism is copying text from a source without citing the original author.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="do-ai-produce-free-plagiarism-content"><strong>Do AI content generators produce free plagiarism content?</strong></h2>



<p>There is a lot of debate on the internet about the use of AI content generators to produce <a href="https://www.paraphraser.io/plagiarism-checker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagiarism free</a> content. While some people believe that these tools produce high quality and unique content, others think that the content generated is not plagiarism-free and is full of errors.</p>



<p>There are many AI content generators available online, and most of them are free to use. However, the quality of the content produced by these tools varies from generator to generator. Some AI generators produce content that is very similar to the original, while others produce content that is completely different.</p>



<p>Some people argue that it is unethical and immoral to use these tools to produce content that is not original. Others argue that as long as the content is not passed off as being original, there is no harm in using AI content generators.</p>



<p>The truth is that there is no objectively right or wrong answer when it comes to this debate. It is up to each individual business to decide whether or not they want to use AI content generators to produce plagiarism content.</p>



<p>The fact is, AI content generators are still in their early stages of development. As they continue to evolve, it is likely that we will see more sophisticated and accurate ways of detecting plagiarism. For now, it is important to be cautious about the content produced by AI generators, and to use other methods to verify the accuracy of the content.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="can-ai-write-blogs"><strong>Can AI write blog articles?</strong></h2>



<p>It’s a question that has been debated for quite some time now. There are many factors to consider when evaluating this question. One of the most important factors is whether or not the blog article is written in a conversational style.</p>



<p>The answer to this question is yes, AI can write blog articles. But they cannot do so in the same way as a human writer would. The technology available today does not have the capability to understand and produce natural language, which is what humans use when they communicate with one another.</p>



<p>The technology that we have available today can produce machine-generated text which sounds like natural language but it cannot be used for human communication because it lacks context and understanding of human emotion and culture. This type of text may be good for marketing businesses.</p>



<p>There is a lot of discussion about the role of artificial intelligence in content marketing. Some people believe that AI can write blog articles that are just as good, if not better, than those written by humans.</p>



<p>There are several companies that are already using AI to help with content creation. One example is Wibbitz, which uses AI to create videos from text-based articles. Another company, Quill, uses AI to help writers create high-quality content by providing feedback on things like grammar, style, and tone.</p>



<p>So far, AI has been shown to be effective in helping to improve human workflow.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-ai-content-generator-tools-can-do"><strong>Besides Writing articles, What AI Content Generator tools can do?</strong></h2>

<p>Mueller also says content written by AI falls into the category of auto-generated content which can result in mannual penalties.</p>



<p>This topic was recently picked up at the Google Search Central SEO office time hangout as an answer to questions about GPT3 AI writing tools.</p>



<p>What’s interesting is for me that how can AI&nbsp; detect another AI when Google itself uses AI products in its system? This question should be asked to the Tech Elite of the Google Team.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="can-ai-detect-ai"><strong>Can Google detect AI Generated Content?</strong></h2>



<p>This question is asked by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohanchaubey1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rohan Chaubey</a> regarding Google’s system to identify content written by machine learning tools.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can Google detect the difference between content written by humans &amp; content written by machines?</strong></h3>



<p>Mueller response shocks me, Mueller makes no claim about Google’s automatic detection of AI Generated Content. but if we see that something is automatically generated, then the <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/glossary-webspam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">webspam team</a> can definately take action on that.</p>



<p>According to me, It’s not possible at the moment for AI to detect AI.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="will-ai-content-be-unique"><strong>Will my AI Contents Generator be unique?</strong></h2>



<p>The answer to this question is that it depends. There are a few things to take into consideration when it comes to the uniqueness of your AI content generator.</p>



<p><em>Never just copy &amp; paste generated contents as it is in your articles. Makes sure to check the relevancy of your topic, tweak it, reprhase it, add focus keywords &amp; most important scan whether it add value to the audience or not.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="does-ai-produce-seo-friendly-contents"><strong>Does AI Writer Produce SEO Friendly Contents?</strong></h2>



<p>Well, most of popular AI writer like Jasper, Rytr &amp; others claim to produce SEO Friendly Contents but you cannot just only depend on them &amp; copy paste contents thinking it’s SEO friendly. Add targeted keywords &amp; phrases yourself in order to make more SEO Friendly Contents so that google can rank it well.</p>



<p>There is no clear answer as to whether AI-generated content is SEO friendly or not. This is because the algorithms used by AI writers are constantly changing, and what may be effective today may not work tomorrow. Also Google SEO algorithm factors keep changing so you can’t just rely on tools.</p>



<p>Blogs should be written for people not Google, when that is done they will naturally rank well.As there is saying “Content is King”.</p>



<p>That being said, there are some things you can do to make your AI-generated content more SEO friendly. For example, you can use keywords and phrases in your titles and descriptions, and make sure your content is well-structured and easy to read.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="does-google-trust-ai-contents"><strong>Does Google trust AI-Generated content?</strong></h2>



<p>Google has been using AI for a while now to generate content for its products. The company has been using a machine learning algorithm called RankBrain(RankBrain is a part of Google’s Hummingbird algorithm). RankBrain uses AI to interpret the meaning of queries and then determine the best results to show users.</p>



<p>Some people are concerned that Google will eventually rely on AI-generated content so much that it will no longer need human-generated content. However, Google has said that it still relies on human beings to create high-quality content.</p>



<p>The short answer is NO. As I said above, automatic AI generated content is against Google Webmaster Guidelines but if you organize content by taking ON page SEO consideration then google might trust.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="can-ai-content-rank-on-google"><strong>Can AI content rank on Google?</strong></h2>



<p><em>Yes, AI content can rank on Google</em>. It’s not secret that AI is becoming more and more involved in content marketing. In fact, over 50% of marketers are already using AI to help with content creation. And, with the release of Google RankBrain, it’s become even more important for businesses to use AI to create content that ranks well on Google.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="does-google-adsense-accept-ai-contents"><strong>Does Google Adsense accept AI Generated Content?</strong></h2>



<p>Yes, if it meets Google guidelines &amp; Adsense policies but if generated content goes against Google guidelines then it simply doesn’t accept it.</p>



<p>The program policies of Google AdSense do not specifically mention AI-generated content. It’s crucial to remember that Google AdSense has stringent requirements for the caliber and originality of content.</p>



<p>Depending on its nature, AI-generated material may present difficulties in adhering to Google’s criteria. Websites are required under AdSense standards to offer users relevant and original content. Content produced entirely by AI without any human input might not fit these requirements.</p>



<p>Review the program policies and quality standards of AdSense to guarantee compliance, and if in question, ask the AdSense support staff for clarification on the particular use case or kind of AI-generated content you have in mind.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="does-google-accept-human-and-ai-contents"><strong>Does Google Adsense Accept New Websites in which Content is written with AI tools or mixed with AI-Generated Content &amp; Human Written Content?</strong></h2>



<p>As I mentioned above, whether it’s generated content or manually written content, it has to meet Google guidelines &amp; policies in order for AdSense to show ads on the website.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-ai-writing-free"><strong>Is AI writing free?</strong></h2>



<p>The AI writing tools provide both free &amp; paid plans. Yes, AI writing tools are free to use with limited features like words count.</p>
